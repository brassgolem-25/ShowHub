### Technologies to Use (Basic MEAN Stack):

1. **Frontend (Angular)**:
   - **Angular Material** for UI components (forms, buttons, cards).
   - **Reactive Forms** for login, registration, and event creation.
   - **Routing** to handle event pages, user profiles, and admin dashboards.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**:
   - **User authentication** (using JWT or OAuth).
   - **API endpoints** for managing users, events, bookings.
   - **Role-based access control** to restrict certain endpoints (only organizers can create events, only admins can manage users).
   
3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - Store user details, event information, and bookings.
   - Schema design: collections for users, events, bookings, and reviews (if implemented).

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy on **AWS** using **EC2** for the backend, **S3** for static assets (like images), and **RDS** or **MongoDB Atlas** for the database.

### Basic UI Mockup Idea:

1. **Landing Page**:
   - **Search Bar** to find events.

   - A list of events with filters (by date, category, location).
   - Each event as a card showing basic info.

4. **Event Detail Page**:
   - Full event details with a button to **register** or **book tickets**.
   - Map (Google Maps API) showing the event location.

5. **Organizer Dashboard**:
   - Lists all events created by the organizer with quick stats.
   - Button to **create a new event**.

6. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Control panel showing system metrics.
   - Manage users, categories, and events.

### Future Enhancements:
- Add a **calendar view** for events.
- Build a **mobile app** version with push notifications.
